# Health-Cost-Predictor-DNN-Regression
Part of a series of projects to attain my Machine Learning certification in Python.

This model uses DNN-Regression to determine health costs based on a persons characteristics (For Ex: sex, smoker, age, bmi, location, # of children) within a mean absolute error of ~$2890. Since this uses linear regression, and there may be other factors not accounted for, more categories would be neccessary to reduce this further.
